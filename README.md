# KN34Bank
Final and first project. KN34Bank

Main idea is to create an internet bank (IB) interface where user can register or login into a system and make some operations like money transfers, check user profile data, review balance, check transaction history and logout from the system.

At the moment there are available the following operations:
- New user registration
- Existing user login 
- Check balance and user data
